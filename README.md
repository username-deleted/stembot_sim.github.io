# SIMbot | UNO Capstone Project
### About
Unity simulation build project for Prairie STEM and STEMbot for UNO Capstone.

Team Members:
- Mason Fleming
- Cassie Miller
- Jackson Henery

Description:
 - This simulation is a virtual representation of the Physical STEMbot 2. 
 - It has simulated physics and a 3D model of the STEMbot 2. 
 - The focus of this simulation is to allow K-12 graders to learn and practice STEM skills with the STEMbot 2 remotely.
This will help ease the learning curve if and when they use the real physical STEMbot.

How to run simulation in Unity Editor: (A Standalone Executable will be created as our final deliverable of the simulation)
  - Verify Unity Version 2020.1.20f1 is installed.
  - Import project into Unity.
  - Make sure the 'FinalMainMenu' scene is loaded.
  - Press play button at top to run simulation.

Controls: 
  - Tank Control Scheme:
    W - Left Wheel Forward
    S - Left Wheel Backward
    I - Right Wheel Forward
    K - Right Wheel Backward
    
  - Classis Keyboard Control Scheme:
    W/S - Forwards and Backwards
    A/D - Turn Left and Right
    
  - Controller Scheme (Classic):
    Left Stick - Fowards/Backwards

### Whatâ€™s new in milestone 3:
- Added customization for the chassis color to the main menu.
- Fixed the camera to work in all levels.
- Tweaked the camera mode swapping.
- Fixed inconsistencies in the back wheels that caused the back left wheel to float, and tweaked the wheel collision in an attempt to stop the SIMbot from being a hunchback.
- Added main menu sounds.
- Added foliage to fourth level.
- Added fifth level, parkour course.
